      <description>Introduction I have finally got the chance to experiment with google apps script, and decided to use it to make my school life easier.
I used google apps script along with the calendar api to create a web app that can auto generate my class schedule based on another calendar provided by my school.

Method The script first pulls all the events from an existing calendar given a certain range for the date, and then it generates a new calendar.</description>

      <description>Introduction When I was doing the DEF CON CTF Qualifier last weekend, I came across an interesting question where you need to create two pdf files with the same SHA1 hash.
Research I know SHA1 hash was already broken when google blogged about creating the first SHA1 collision, but I was not sure that I can reproduce the process with limited hardware.
Result In the end, I came across this website that is able to generate two PDF files with the same SHA1 hash using two JPG images based on this paper.</description>
