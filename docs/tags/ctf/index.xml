      <description>Introduction When I was doing the DEF CON CTF Qualifier last weekend, I came across an interesting question where you need to create two pdf files with the same SHA1 hash.

Result In the end, I came across this website that is able to generate two PDF files with the same SHA1 hash using two JPG images based on this paper.</description>
