      <description>Credit: dev.generals.io   What is Generals.io? Generals.io is a turn-based strategy game that can be played in the browser. Each player starts out with one grid on a large map that is called the general. The goal of the game is to expand and eliminate other players&amp;rsquo; generals. Once a player&amp;rsquo;s general gets taken, the player loses the game, and in the end, the last player standing wins the game.</description>

      <description>Development environment with vscode and iTerm   Problem There is a used-book sale program at our school, and currently, it is difficult to find books people want as books are not indexed and sorted properly. The maintainers all mentioned the experience of being asked wherever a specific book is within the large collection of books.
Solution I attempt to make an efficient system for indexing all the books and encourage more people to buy books they want from the book sale.</description>
