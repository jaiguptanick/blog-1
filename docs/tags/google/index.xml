  What is Generals.io? Generals.io is a turn-based strategy game that can be played in the browser. Each player starts out with one grid on a large map that is called the general. The goal of the game is to expand and eliminate other players&amp;rsquo; generals. Once a player&amp;rsquo;s general gets taken, the player loses the game, and in the end, the last player standing wins the game.</description>

      <description>Introduction I have finally got the chance to experiment with google apps script, and decided to use it to make my school life easier.
I used google apps script along with the calendar api to create a web app that can auto generate my class schedule based on another calendar provided by my school.

Method The script first pulls all the events from an existing calendar given a certain range for the date, and then it generates a new calendar.</description>
