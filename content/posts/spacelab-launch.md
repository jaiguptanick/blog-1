# The project

SpaceLab is a school program at the Singapore American School. The program allows students to create a space experiment that will be sent to the international space station for one month.

This is the second year of the program. A team of eleven students including me created a experiment that seeks to test the effect of micro-gravity on electro-plating copper.

# Technological challenges

I was responsible for both the electrical circuits and the programming aspect of the project. I was able to practice my knowledge regarding electronics and improve my solder skill. I also learned how to program in P-BASIC and write efficient code that is reliable.

# The event

Yesterday, our experiment was finally launched by NASA after one year of hard work. The payload was carried by an Antares rocket that is going to the ISS. Hopefully, we will soon recvive images and sensor data from our experiment if everything goes well.
